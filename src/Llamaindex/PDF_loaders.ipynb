Arnault became the first French person to top the list.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world\\'s wealthiest individuals and sometimes groups or families who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions. Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual\\'s holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded.\\n---\\nThe World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\nstock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual\\'s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual\\'s true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.\\n\\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire\\'s fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members\\'). Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.\\n\\nAnnual rankings\\n\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\n\\nLegend\\n\\n|Icon|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Has not changed from the previous ranking.| |\\n|Has increased from the previous ranking.| |\\n|Has decreased from the previous ranking.| |\\n\\n2023\\n\\nIn the 37th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Nearly half the list is poorer than the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2. The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world\\'s richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Primary source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Bernard Arnault & family|$211 billion|74|France|LVMH|\\n|2|Elon Musk|$180 billion|51|United States|Tesla, SpaceX, X Corp.|\\n|3|Jeff Bezos|$114 billion|59|United States|Amazon|\\n|4|Larry Ellison|$107 billion|78|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|5|Warren Buffett|$106 billion|92|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|6|Bill Gates|$104 billion|67|United States|Microsoft|\\n|7|Michael Bloomberg|$94.5 billion|81|United States|Bloomberg L.P.|\\n|8|Carlos Slim & family|$93 billion|83|Mexico|Telmex, América Móvil, Grupo Carso|\\n|9|Mukesh Ambani|$83.4 billion|65|India|Reliance Industries|\\n|10|Steve Ballmer|$80.7 billion|67|United States|Microsoft|\\n\\nIn the 36th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,668 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.7 trillion, down 97 members from 2021.\\n\\nSource: Wikipedia\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Elon Musk|$219 billion|50|United States|Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter Inc|\\n|2|Jeff Bezos|$177 billion|58|United States|Amazon|\\n|3|Bernard Arnault & family|$158 billion|73|France|LVMH|\\n|4|Bill Gates|$129 billion|66|United States|Microsoft|\\n|5|Warren Buffett|$118 billion|91|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|6|Larry Page|$111 billion|49|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|7|Sergey Brin|$107 billion|48|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|8|Larry Ellison|$106 billion|77|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|9|Steve Ballmer|$91.4 billion|66|United States|Microsoft|\\n|10|Mukesh Ambani|$90.7 billion|64|India|Reliance Industries|\\n\\nIn the 35th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,755 billionaires with a total net wealth of $13.1 trillion, up 660 members from 2020; 86% of these billionaires had more wealth than they possessed last year.\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Jeff Bezos|$177 billion|57|United States|Amazon|\\n|2|Elon Musk|$151 billion|49|United States|Tesla, SpaceX|\\n|3|Bernard Arnault & family|$150 billion|72|France|LVMH|\\n|4|Bill Gates|$124 billion|65|United States|Microsoft|\\n|5|Mark Zuckerberg|$97 billion|36|United States|Meta Platforms|\\n|6|Warren Buffett|$96 billion|90|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|7|Larry Ellison|$93 billion|76|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|8|Larry Page|$91.5 billion|48|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|9|Sergey Brin|$89 billion|47|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|10|Mukesh Ambani|$84.5 billion|63|India|Reliance Industries|\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\nIn the 34th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,095 billionaires with a total net wealth of $8 trillion, down 58 members and $700 billion from 2019; 51% of these billionaires had less wealth than they possessed last year.

However, once the dot-com bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear. Billionaires\\' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires. The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world saw their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Number and combined net worth of billionaires by year\\n\\n|Year|Number of billionaires|Group\\'s combined net worth|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|2023[2]|2,640|$12.2 trillion|\\n|2022[6]|2,668|$12.7 trillion|\\n|2021[11]|2,755|$13.1 trillion|\\n|2020|2,095|$8.0 trillion|\\n|2019|2,153|$8.7 trillion|\\n|2018|2,208|$9.1 trillion|\\n|2017|2,043|$7.7 trillion|\\n|2016|1,810|$6.5 trillion|\\n|2015[18]|1,826|$7.1 trillion|\\n|2014[67]|1,645|$6.4 trillion|\\n|2013[68]|1,426|$5.4 trillion|\\n|2012|1,226|$4.6 trillion|\\n|2011|1,210|$4.5 trillion|\\n|2010|1,011|$3.6 trillion|\\n|2009|793|$2.4 trillion|\\n|2008|1,125|$4.4 trillion|\\n|2007|946|$3.5 trillion|\\n|2006|793|$2.6 trillion|\\n|2005|691|$2.2 trillion|\\n|2004|587|$1.9 trillion|\\n|2003|476|$1.4 trillion|\\n|2002|497|$1.5 trillion|\\n|2001|538|$1.8 trillion|\\n|2000|470|$898 billion|\\n\\nSources: Forbes.[18][67][66][68]\\n\\n# See also\\n\\n- Biography portal\\n- Economics portal\\n- World portal\\n- Bloomberg Billionaires Index\\n- List of centibillionaires\\n- List of cities by number of billionaires\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\nList of countries by number of billionaires\\n\\nList of wealthiest animals\\n\\nList of wealthiest families\\n\\nList of wealthiest historical figures\\n\\nList of wealthiest religious organizations\\n\\n# References\\n\\n# Specific\\n\\n1.

    "'# The World\\'s Billionaires\\n\\nThe World\\'s Billionaires is an annual ranking of people who are considered to have a net worth of $1 billion or more, by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987. The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists. This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.\\n\\nThe net worth of the world\\'s billionaires increased from less than US$1 trillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2015.\\n\\n# Publication details\\n\\n|Publisher|Whale Media Investments|\\n|---|---|\\n|Publication|Forbes|\\n|First published|March 1987|\\n|Latest publication|April 4, 2023|\\n\\n# Current list details (2023)\\n\\n|Wealthiest|Bernard Arnault|\\n|---|---|\\n|Net worth (1st)|US$211 billion|\\n|Number of billionaires|2,640 (from 2668)|\\n|Total list net worth|US$12.2 trillion (from US$ 12.7 trillion)|\\n|Number of women|337|\\n|New members to the list|150|\\n\\nIn 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was ranked at the top for the first time and became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking, surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the previous 24 years. In 2022, after topping the list for four years, Bezos was surpassed by Elon Musk. In 2023, Musk was in turn surpassed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, after topping the list for just a year. Arnault became the first French person to top the list.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world\\'s wealthiest individuals and sometimes groups or families who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions. Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual\\'s holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded.\\n---\\nThe World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\nstock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual\\'s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual\\'s true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.\\n\\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire\\'s fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members\\'). Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.\\n\\nAnnual rankings\\n\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\n\\nLegend\\n\\n|Icon|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Has not changed from the previous ranking.| |\\n|Has increased from the previous ranking.| |\\n|Has decreased from the previous ranking.| |\\n\\n2023\\n\\nIn the 37th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Nearly half the list is poorer than the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2. The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world\\'s richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Primary source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Bernard Arnault & family|$211 billion|74|France|LVMH|\\n|2|Elon Musk|$180 billion|51|United States|Tesla, SpaceX, X Corp.|\\n|3|Jeff Bezos|$114 billion|59|United States|Amazon|\\n|4|Larry Ellison|$107 billion|78|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|5|Warren Buffett|$106 billion|92|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|6|Bill Gates|$104 billion|67|United States|Microsoft|\\n|7|Michael Bloomberg|$94.5 billion|81|United States|Bloomberg L.P.|\\n|8|Carlos Slim & family|$93 billion|83|Mexico|Telmex, América Móvil, Grupo Carso|\\n|9|Mukesh Ambani|$83.4 billion|65|India|Reliance Industries|\\n|10|Steve Ballmer|$80.7 billion|67|United States|Microsoft|\\n\\nIn the 36th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,668 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.7 trillion, down 97 members from 2021.\\n\\nSource: Wikipedia\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Elon Musk|$219 billion|50|United States|Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter Inc|\\n|2|Jeff Bezos|$177 billion|58|United States|Amazon|\\n|3|Bernard Arnault & family|$158 billion|73|France|LVMH|\\n|4|Bill Gates|$129 billion|66|United States|Microsoft|\\n|5|Warren Buffett|$118 billion|91|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|6|Larry Page|$111 billion|49|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|7|Sergey Brin|$107 billion|48|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|8|Larry Ellison|$106 billion|77|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|9|Steve Ballmer|$91.4 billion|66|United States|Microsoft|\\n|10|Mukesh Ambani|$90.7 billion|64|India|Reliance Industries|\\n\\nIn the 35th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,755 billionaires with a total net wealth of $13.1 trillion, up 660 members from 2020; 86% of these billionaires had more wealth than they possessed last year.\\n\\n|No.|Name|Net worth (USD)|Age|Nationality|Source(s) of wealth|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|Jeff Bezos|$177 billion|57|United States|Amazon|\\n|2|Elon Musk|$151 billion|49|United States|Tesla, SpaceX|\\n|3|Bernard Arnault & family|$150 billion|72|France|LVMH|\\n|4|Bill Gates|$124 billion|65|United States|Microsoft|\\n|5|Mark Zuckerberg|$97 billion|36|United States|Meta Platforms|\\n|6|Warren Buffett|$96 billion|90|United States|Berkshire Hathaway|\\n|7|Larry Ellison|$93 billion|76|United States|Oracle Corporation|\\n|8|Larry Page|$91.5 billion|48|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|9|Sergey Brin|$89 billion|47|United States|Alphabet Inc.|\\n|10|Mukesh Ambani|$84.5 billion|63|India|Reliance Industries|\\n---\\n# The World\\'s Billionaires - Wikipedia\\n\\nIn the 34th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,095 billionaires with a total net wealth of $8 trillion, down 58 members and $700 billion from 2019; 51% of these billionaires had less wealth than they possessed last year.

However, once the dot-com bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear. Billionaires\\' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires. The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses.
